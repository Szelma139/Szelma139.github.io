JQUERY - javascript library, well known for simplifying usage of selectors. If something can be done easier, why make it hard ? Ok but how it works, let's see.

Selecting html DOM element can in typical js can be done like this.
`let changer = document.querySelector(".changer");`

Handler in jquery - >
`$(element)`
where element is:
`".class"`
`"#id"`
`"h1"`

Full syntax can look like this:


Select:
```
$('a') - every link element from website.
$('.radek') - everything with 'radek' class.
$(document) - whole document, ofc you can do that.
```

Elements can be pinned to handler by **html** oraz **css**. First can change parameters of selector, second one it's style - css. And can be both setter and getter for pinned handler. And it is similiar to banned way of doing it, I mean well used in industry **innerhtml**. shenanigans.

` var obraz = "url(img/" + cards[nr] + " + ");` -- parameter cards is an array of new files
`$('#c0').css('background-image, obraz);` -- background-image set as 'obraz' string.
`var opacity = $('#c').css('opacity')` - getter
`var opacity = $('#c').css('opacity', '0.8')` - setter

See ya'll.
