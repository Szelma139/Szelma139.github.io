So I decided to write (more like a copy cat) some stuff acout automating systemd. 
So it might look like this:

`
/opt/app/ClientQt.sh
`

```
#!/bin/bash
unset QT_PLUGIN_PATH
appname=$(basename "$0" .sh)
dirname=$(dirname "$0")
cd "$dirname/bin"
export Ld_LIBRARY_PATH=`pwd`
./$appname "$@"


```

```
appname=($basename "$0" .sh)  - take appname and delete extension.
```


```
dirname = $(dirname "$0") 

same as: dirname /opt/aplikacja/  
```

```
export Ld_LIBRARY_PATH=`pwd` - export library from current work tree, in this case dirname/bin -> /opt/app/bin/

```

And bin is binary/execuatable version of program, one expecting libraries to work, ld is taking care of it.
```
"$@" - call with parameters.
```


See ya'll.
